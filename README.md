ODM Analysis package
============

Description
------------

The 'odmanalysis' package for python is a comprehensive toolkit for the semi-automated analysis of optical-displacement measurements in MEMS devices as described in Kokorian2014. It takes a data.csv input file that contains a series of captured intensity profiles at different actuator voltages and and analyzes the displacement of a peak in the intensity profile with respect the the position of the peak in the first intensity profile.
